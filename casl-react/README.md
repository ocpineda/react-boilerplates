# CASL React boiler plate

This seed is an example boilerplate for stainly's [CASL](https://github.com/stalniy/casl-react-example).  I used CASL with the [create react app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Since I'm still learning, this boilerplate is sparse, and may not comply with best practices.

## Resources
- See the [README](../README.md) for all React boilerplates in this repo.
