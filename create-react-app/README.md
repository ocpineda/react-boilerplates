# Create React App

This uses the [create-react-app[(https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) from Facebook
  
I set the port to something other than the default __3000__. In the app, you can set this with a `.env` file and change the port there. ex:
```BASH
PORT=3020
```

## Must haves

- [] React 16.8+ for hooks
- [] React Router   
`npm install react-router-dom`
